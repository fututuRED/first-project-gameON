DON'T BE SCARED



Danish and English shares a lot of similarities and this game will hover over some of them!

<h2> About </h2>
  It's been a couple of years that I've started learning Danish and, surprisingly, I haven't found it this much difficult...
  But mind, you, "Hvornår spiller vi brætspil?" sounds rather mean if you have no idea how Danish works! 
  But do not worry, and for those of you, and I can see some have already some clues about what "vi" could mean--"vi", "wi" oh "we"?--and you too, linguists ! 
  "A question mark must be associated to some wh- word... oh wait a minute "wh"... "hv", is there a link. Not a question."
  Indeed, this is one of the similarities and having a good laugh won't slow anything. 
  So there you are, given the opportunity to discover some of those 4-letter-words that I've thoughtfully chosen, 
  with some usefull--I do hope-- hints to help you come on board !


  
<h2> Rules </h2>
<ul> 
<li> 4 trials </li>
<li> 4 words to guess </li>
<li> If the letter is correct, and where it should be clap clap : GREEN </li>
<li> If the letter is not where it should be but still, you have some insctincts : YELLOW </li>
<li> If you struggle with the hints--my bad, ok : RED</li>
</ul>
